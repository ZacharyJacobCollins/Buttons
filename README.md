<h1>Shout: a Kent-State Hackathon project. </h1>

<p> Using a spark core, and an led matrix we created wearable "buttons" that display custom messages. </p1>

<p> Messages sent using a curl request to our API endpoint. </p1>

<p> Also includes a Twitter scraper to allow buttons to receive local hackathon updates, from the Kent State Hackathon </p>
